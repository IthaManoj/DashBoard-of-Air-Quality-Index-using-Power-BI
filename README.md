# Data Visualization of Air Quality Index in Different Cities

  This repository contains the power BI dashboard which I have created with the help of data I have.
  
  The data was extracted the from the government website on  March 24, 2021.
  
  I have cleaned the data using Excel and filled the gaps which are required manually in Excel as it is a small dataset.
